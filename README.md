A simple documentation colaboration tool to meant to be hosted on a static site, and maintained using Git.
Philosophy:
- No external JavaScript libraries to prevent any security vulnerability and absolute control.
- Tree like Structure, to allow themes and subthemes
- Most Markdown Support Including images, code blocks, tables and diagrams
- Colaboration throught Git Pull Requests: A new document should be uploaded in the repository as .md and it will be reflected in the site
- Both Light Theme and Dark Theme
- Search Bar to search all text
Tech stack:
HTML - CSS - Javascript

## To add a document:

1. Add your `.md` file in the `docs` folder (or a subfolder)
2. If your doc contains images, place them in a folder with the same name as your doc (without .md)
3. **Push to main branch** - The GitHub Action will automatically update `docs.json` with your new document

The `docs.json` file is automatically generated by a GitHub Action when you push changes to the `docs/` folder. It includes:
- Document paths
- Date added (from git history)
- Documents are sorted by date (most recent first) in the "All Articles" tab

### Manual docs.json format (if needed):
```json
{
    "Category Name": {
        "YourDocument.md": {
            "path": "docs/YourDocument.md",
            "date": "2025-12-05"
        }
    }
}
```

For nested folders:
```json
{
    "Category": {
        "Subcategory": {
            "Document.md": {
                "path": "docs/Category/Subcategory/Document.md",
                "date": "2025-12-05"
            }
        }
    }
}
```
